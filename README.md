# User Management
A simple React app that uses JSON for storing authentication and viewing users via the JSON placeholder API.

## Features
* Redux
* Hooks
* TypeScript
* Semantic UI

## Building
* `npm i` - install dependencies 
* `npm build` - Will build the project ready for production

## Run project for development
* `npm i` - install dependencies 
* `npm start` - Starts live build of React
* login - username: `steven`, password: `password` or add your own to the users.json file

## What doesn't work
* If you add a user you will not be able to edit it as that user hasn't been created on the backend, editing normal users will work fine

## TODO
* In a few places I have used type any which is not great
